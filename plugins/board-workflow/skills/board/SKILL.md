# /board — Priority Board Snapshot

Show the current priority board: **open work only**, epics in rank order, issues
in pickup order beneath. Default output is a **hierarchy diagram** (owner
preference, 2026-07-12); `/board table` prints the raw resolver table instead.

## Step 1 — pull the data (always)

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pickup/resolve-next.py --list
```

This is the same graph engine `/pickup` uses. READ-ONLY. Self-configures board
coordinates from the repo. Keep its output — it is the data for either renderer.

## Step 1b — dev reconcile (always, from the data already pulled)

From that same output, count the **In Progress** rows per `Dev`. A dev on **2+
In Progress issues is a double-booking** — one dev works one issue at a time.
It happens when two `/pickup` runs read the board before either writes its
claim; the issue-scoped lock cannot see it (see pickup Phase 1.2b).

Surface it in one line under the widget and offer to reassign — do not silently
fix it. The cost is not lost work: it is a **phantom-busy board**, which makes
the next `/pickup` STOP on "all three devs busy" while a dev sits idle.

To resolve which claim came second, read the claim comments — they carry the
authoritative timestamp and worktree:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json comments -q '.comments[].body' | grep -oE '🔒 Claimed by .*'
```

Reassign the **later** claim to the most senior genuinely-free dev (seniority
order = the resolver's `devs` line) by setting the board's Dev field, and comment
on the issue saying what happened. Zero In Progress rows, or one per dev → say
nothing.

## Step 2 — render

**If the argument is `table`, or the `mcp__visualize__show_widget` tool is
unavailable:** print the resolver's Markdown table verbatim, no commentary.

**Otherwise (default): render the hierarchy widget.** Call
`mcp__visualize__read_me` (modules: ["diagram"]) silently if not already loaded
this session, then `mcp__visualize__show_widget` with an HTML tree built from
the resolver output plus the visible epics' bodies:

- **One card per standing bucket / top-level epic, in rank order** (rank badge
  `rN · #issue` + title). Children indent inside with a left border rail.
- **Umbrella epics** (children are epics) render as an outer card containing
  nested area-epic cards in rank order — the hierarchy must be visible.
- **Issues** render as compact rows: `#N` muted · title · status. In-progress
  items get an accent chip with the dev name. Blocked epics get a warning chip
  naming what they wait on (from their body's `Depends-on:` line).
- **Groups render as ONE row.** The resolver already collapses riders: a lead
  row arrives carrying `(+ #a #b …)`. Render it as a single row with a
  `group of N` chip and the rider numbers muted after the title — never as
  separate rows per rider. The group is the unit of execution; the board must
  read in group units, not confetti.
- **Lanes:** if an epic's body has `### <name> lane` sections, render them as
  side-by-side columns with the body's pickup order and its `→ after #N` /
  `∥` (parallel-safe) annotations.
- **Containers** (Express Lane / Odds & Ends / Back Burner) compress to a
  single row: rank, name, item count (list items only if ≤3).
- **On-staging items** compress to one muted footnote line.
- Follow the visualize design rules: CSS variables only, flat, sentence case,
  no emoji (Tabler icons ok), font ≥11px, weights 400/500.

After the widget, write at most one line of text — the single most decision-
relevant fact (e.g. what gate opens next). No re-narration of the diagram.

## Errors

- **GitHub rate limit**: run `gh api rate_limit --jq .resources.graphql`, tell
  the user the reset time. Do not loop-retry.
- **Could not resolve board coordinates**: tell the user to set
  `PICKUP_OWNER`/`PICKUP_PROJECT` or add `.claude/pickup.json`.
